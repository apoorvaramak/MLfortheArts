<span style= "font-size:16px">**After playing Quick, Draw in class, reviewing the Quick, Draw, and reading the above Exploring and Visualizing an Open Global Dataset by Google Research, consider the following question. How can visualization help diagnose "data for inclusion" and "identify concrete ways that anyone can improve the variety of data, as well as check for potential biases."** </span>

Visualization is a tool that can be used to solve many problems with data because images are a universal language. The inclusivity of data is something that is becoming very important as artificial intelligence becomes more and more prominent. Being able to see how people see things from different cultures and perspectives creates a much more inclusive data set because it creates data from how everyone sees it. For example, in the blog post, it talks about sandwiches. The orientation of the sandwiches and the bread it was on is drawn very differently depending on where in the world the artist is. So, visualizing this data can make data more inclusive because visualization can be used to quickly establish larger patterns. This also aids in identifying ways that data can be improved because it shows how certain groups interpret the same thing differently. So, including both iterations in the dataset will make the dataset more accurate for everyone. Accuracy being up for more people and groups is a great way to check for bias because if a dataset is biased towards a certain group, its data can be used to uphold unfair systems. Improving data is about making it more comprehensive so that it can be applied to more situations.

This week, I wanted to create something that incorporated what we learned this week with what we've been working on in the past. So, I used posenet and the Quick Draw data set to make a program that puts a cat's face over yours, like a fun mask. With Halloween coming up, I thought this would be a fun costume-esque idea. By combining the posenet full body example and the quick draw example that generates cats that are drawn by people for the quick draw set, I was able to achieve this. I ran into a few problems, such as resizing for when you are closer or further from your webcam. I tried to do this with the distance between the eyes like we did in the past, but that created some new problems. The face resizes but now when too close, the picture moves down and left from the face. Also, while creating this project I realized that not everyone drew the cats as a cats face, some drew whole bodies, which didn't make as much sense with my project. However, this was interesting because it's a great example of how different people visualize the same thing differently.
