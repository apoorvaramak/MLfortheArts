<span style= "font-size:16px"> **What surprises you about this data set? What questions do you have? Thinking back to last week’s assignment, can you think of any ethical considerations around how this data was collected. Are there privacy considerations with the data?** </span>

This data set surprises me because of the sheer volume of images. They have collected millions of images, which is an unfathomable amount of data. Most of the pictures are of things in nature, which I understand in the sense that they would have access to a lot of images of animals and maybe less of things like tools. But the discrepancy was still surprising because there are just so many more pictures of nature than anything else. Ethically, I think it is interesting how they got these images. Especially because there is a category for humans. Even more interestingly, the website says that it does not have the copyright to these images, so these are other people’s images that they are using. How they collected pictures of people that are not theirs’ could definitely be an ethical consideration to be looked into. Also,I believe the owners of the images should have the right to know that their images are being used for machine learning algorithms because maybe they don’t want the images they own to be used in this way. How the pictures of people are used should be a privacy consideration because these images of people are being used in experiments possibly without their consent. 

<span style= "font-size:16px"> **Using the ml5.js examples above, try running image classification on a variety of images. Pick at least 10 objects in your room. How many of these does it recognize? What other aspects of the image affect the classification, including but not limited to position, scale, lighting, etc.** </span>

It recognized 3 of the 10 images that I tried to classify. It got my glasses, an electric fan, and a bottle of advil. Some things it did not get were earbuds, which it said was a 
stethoscope. There were different guesses (vacuum, miniskirt, etc.) that changed depending on the orientation of the earbuds. For the scissors, it was unable to identify them at all, 
saying that it is a can opener. I tried with a ring, wearing it and just holding it up to the camera. However, both times it just kept saying microphone. My water bottle kept coming up
as punching bag, which may makes sense because it is a little oddly shaped for a water bottle. My keys surprised me because they kept showing up as a computer/tool kit no matter what 
angle or wear they were placed. For hand sanitizer, I kept getting sunblock, but that might be because of the shape of the bottle, it is not a pump bottle like a lot of hand sanitizers. 
Finally, i was not able to recognize my pencil. Depending on how it was oriented, the guess changed from syringe to flagstaff to microphone. I thought some of the things that it was not
able to identify were interesting because some of them are very clear pictures of items that I think are very normal, like keys and earbuds. I figured that there would be tons of pictures of these in the ImageNet for the program to compare to. Also, I was surprised that the glasses were better identified when I was wearing them versus just pointing the webcam at them. I thought that on my face it would think to identify me, not the glasses.
