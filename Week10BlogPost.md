The more I use Runway, the more I understand the benefits of it. With barely any knowledge of p5, I could easily make a script that utilizes a machine learning algorithm. This is so cool to me because machine learning feels like something that is usually pretty inaccessible. The barrier to entry for machine learning seems to be much lower with Runway. This is huge because as machine learning becomes increasingly a part of our lives, making sure that everyone has access to it is becoming more important. Hosting a model and moving it into p5 took very little work other than hiding the token. In every other instance of machine learning that I have had to do, it has taken a lot more knowledge of code and how machine learning works. This just required a basic understanding of p5 and a Runway account.

For my p5 sketch, I based it off the sketch we were given that inputs an image and outputs a caption.

The model I used was the same one I looked at last week, Deep Dream.

This outputs an image, so I made sure that an image was the output instead. When I did this, it outputted the image right after the button, and it did not look good at all but it was working. I tried to edit it by creating a separate function so that the image generated would replace the image that was entered, because that image was set as the canvas in the beginning. However, I ran into problems while doing that. I had trouble making the first image disappear and making the output appear, and Iâ€™m assuming that that is because the output was showing up behind the image. After some trial and error, I just moved back to the original version.
