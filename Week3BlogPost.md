<span style= "font-size:16px"> **What questions do you still have about the model and the associated data? Are there elements you would propose including in the biography?**</span>

The things I’m curious about with this model are mostly data-related. It says the images are from Flickr but are the photographers asked before their photos are used? 
If they were asked did they know what their pictures were going to be used for? How did they decide which pictures from Flickr to use? I believe that some more elements
could be added to the biography like who are the people that are identifying the data images. Also, are they still collecting data from Flick or have they stopped. 
And when did they stop. These are all important because they paint a picture of what kind of data is included and how the model was trained. 

<span style= "font-size:16px">**How does understanding the provenance of the model and its data inform your creative process?**</span>
Understanding the origin of the model and it’s data informs my creative process because it helps me understand what kind of things this will be more
equipped to do versus what it will be less successful with. For example, I know PoseNet was trained using the CoCoSSD data set. Because the CoCoSSD 
data is of the most identifiable objects and is much smaller than ImageNet, I would not use CoCoSSD to try and identify objects that are more obscure. 
Also, it says that some of the categories came from asking children to name objects inside and outside, which could impact the data because it would not 
include things that are usually out of reach of children or that they’ve never seen before. For the model, understanding why it was created and what it has 
been used for in the past is also important because it can also inform what things are more successful. Furthermore, knowing who created it is important 
because everyone has an agenda and knowing their agenda can greatly impact what is ethical to do with the data. 


<span style= "font-size:16px">**My p5 sketch**</span>
For my p5 sketch, I wanted to see if I could get PoseNet to ask a series of questions and assign points. Creating a point counter proved to 
be quite difficult because to give a point when right or take away a point when wrong, the sketch can't keep looping, but for the sketch to move 
forward, it has to continue to loop. So, the point counter just keeps going up when you hold up the correct hand and keeps going down when you 
hold up the wrong hand. Also, I could not get it to be multiple questions because I had trouble getting the method to stop without stopping the sketch altogether. 
Overall, I was able to get it to increase points when right, decrease points when wrong, and identify shrugging, raising your right hand and raising your left 
hand so it still feels successful.

And here is a gif of me testing it out (Resizing in photoshop messed up the colors sorry):
