# A People's Guide to AI Response
<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **When you hear the words "Artificial Intelligence", what are the first four things that come to your mind?** </span>
* Media with AI trying to destroy the human race
* Facial recognition
* Lil Miquela
* Microsoft’s Tay Bot

<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **Did any of these applications of AI surprise you?** </span>
* Some of these applications are things that I’ve never thought about before like spam filtering and machine translation. It makes sense that these use AI but that’s not how I imagined it being used. 

<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **What are other places where you suspect AI is present?** </span>
* I suppose AI is probably also present in things like spell checking like Grammarly.

<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **Think about the devices and/or digital services you use daily. Write below a list of the top three that are present in your life.** </span>
* Spotify
* Youtube
* Adobe Creative Cloud

<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **What are other places where you suspect AI is present?** </span>
* Spotify suggests new songs for playlists and sometimes it surprises me by how accurate they are to the feel that I want for my playlist. Especially when the artist is not associated with any of the other artists on the playlist.  

|Device/Digital Service   | AI functions  |  
|:---:|---| 
|Email Inbox| * Autocompleting parts of your sentence as part of the email </br> * Changing which nbox you are sending from when you send to a certain person (mobile)|
|Check depositing   | * Analyzing the check so that it can verify the amount and numbers are correct   |   
|Texting/Mobile Keyboards   | * Spell checking </br> * Autocompleting your sentence|  
|Netflix   | * Recommending what else to watch depending on what you have watched  |  
|Google   | * Giving suggestions for the rest of your search |  
|Social Media  | * The suggested pages like the TikTok for you page and Instagram Explore page </br> * Facial recognition for tagging people in facebook | 
|Automated Messaging   | * Responses based on the keywords in your search/voice   |  

<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **What do we gain by having AI in our everyday lives?** </span>
* Having AI in our lives makes life much more efficient because the AI helps you get customer service when no humans are available, finish your words so you don’t have to type the rest, find content that you are interested in quickly, and so much more. AI has a lot of functionality that people use daily that would not be impossible to do without AI, but it’d be much more time consuming and inconvenient. 

<span style= "font-size:16px;"> **What do we lose by having AI in our daily lives?** </span>
* Having AI in our lives does mean that we lose some of our privacy. Everything about us is data stored away somewhere, our faces, our music choices, our interests, and so much more. While these uses of AI make life convenient, they can also be used for more sinister things. Like the book mentioned, AI algorithms can be racist and uphold the prison industrial complex and under the guise of being unbiased.

|<span style= "font-weight:normal;">WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TRYING TO ADDRESS ? </span>  |<span style= "font-weight:normal;"> Many people struggle to get a proper diagnosis of illnesses due to biases in the medical field against many marginalized groups.  |  
|:---:|---| 
|HOW CAN AI HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE? | AI could help solve this issue because many times people are not diagnosed properly because doctors do not know what to look for. For example, skin cancer is much more noticeable on lighter skin, which accounts for part of the reason why people of color have much higher rates of death from skin cancer than their white counterparts. AI could be able to have all the input from the patient and from there formulate suggestions for what could be causing symptoms.|
|WHAT ROLE WILL HUMANS HAVE IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE?  | Humans’ roles are important, they will have to train the AI with large data sets that are very diverse so that AI will not have the same biases as it’s users.   |   
|WHAT DATA DO YOU NEED TO CREATE AN AI TO HELP YOU ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE?    | The AI would need medical as much medical data from people with different illnesses across all different walks of life that have been accurately diagnosed.|  
|HOW WILL YOU RESPONSIBLY GATHER THIS DATA IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS INDIVIDUALS’ PRIVACY AND CONSENT?   | To collect this data, you would need to reach out to hospitals and patients. The names would not be needed so that could help protect their privacy and as long as they give it consensually, which is knowing what it is going to be used for. I believe that this is using the information in a respectful manner.   |
