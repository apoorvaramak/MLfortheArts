<span style= "font-size = 16px;"> **When you hear the words "Artificial Intelligence", what are the first four things that come to your mind?** </span>
* Media with AI trying to destroy the human race
* Facial recognition
* Lil Miquela
* Microsoft’s Tay Bot

<span style= "font-size = 16px;"> **Did any of these applications of AI surprise you?** </span>
* Some of these applications are things that I’ve never thought about before like spam filtering and machine translation. It makes sense that these use AI but that’s not how I imagined it being used. 

<span style= "font-size = 16px;"> **What are other places where you suspect AI is present?** </span>
* I suppose AI is probably also present in things like spell checking like Grammarly.

* Spotify
* Youtube
* Adobe Creative Cloud

<span style= "font-size = 16px;"> **What are other places where you suspect AI is present?** </span>
* Spotify suggests new songs for playlists and sometimes it surprises me by how accurate they are to the feel that I want for my playlist. Especially when the artist is not associated with any of the other artists on the playlist.
