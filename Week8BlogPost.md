<span style= "font-size:16px">**Who do we entrust to do this work?**</span>

Anyone can create AI models, but to be able to do it in a way that honors marginalized people can only be trusted with people that are willing to learn. No one can understand everything from every group that has been marginalized and the willingness to just listen allows for the work of minorities to be displayed in a way that is respectful. LIstening to how members of a community want pieces represented and how they themself are being biased or can be biased is vital to any project that works with marginalized people because otherwise it can lead to a misrepresentation of a group of people that are already being misrepresented or unfairly represented in the media. Contributing to the status quo is not something that AI should do, especially with the power that comes with AI and technology as a whole in society. So, for some to have this much power to create, they have to be able to take feedback and be introspective about their shortcomings and assumptions about people. 


<span style= "font-size:16px">**How do we really do ethics with machine learning?**</span>

Ethics in machine learning is a delicate topic because the power of machine learning has grown so rapidly so quickly that finding a precedent is impossible. So often creation is about seeing what is possible, but not about what is right, especially in the sphere of technology. To truly move towards the ethical in machine learning, there needs to be a lot more emphasis on adding data that is inclusive. This can mean different things in different contexts, but some examples are including more marginalized people in facial recognition algorithms and adding more diverse texts. However, being more inclusive does not automatically mean that it is more ethical, because having more facial recognition could be dangerous for marginalized communities. Ethics in machine learning is also creating for the purposes of uplifting the underrepresented minorities. But to go even further, it’s about uplifting them in a way that is respectful of their culture and community. Giving information without the proper context or information that is not for others through machine learning is just as unethical as not including information that the community would like to be able to make a part of the average person’s consciousness. So, to do ethics in machine learning is to talk to communities and leaders of these communities about how to include information in an honoring way while also being transparent about how the information will be used.

This week I decided to try to make the musical markov chain. I was reading into it on the syllabus for code of music and was really interested after I explored the projects with Markov chains. However, I ran into a few problems. First, the score generator was not working. I was able to get that fixed, but then I realized that I don't know how to find a json text of a score or how exactly that is supposed to look if I were to create my own. I realized that in p5, you are not able to download files from other projects, so I was not able to download the jsons and see what was in them exactly, so I could not create a file that was readable. Also, when I tried to search of jsons of other scores on the internet, it was to no luck. So, I went back to generating text. I created a text file of a lot of recipes that I enjoy. Playing around with the number of letters being used and the number of words outputted gave me some interesting stuff.
